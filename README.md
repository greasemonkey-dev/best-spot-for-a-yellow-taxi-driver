# Taxi Data Analysis  ðŸš•- March 2023

This repository contains the analysis of TLC taxi data for March 2023. The data was analyzed, preprocessed, and manipulated to determine the best places to stand divided by the time of day and whether it's a weekend or weekday.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis is the [TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission) taxi data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) for March 2023. It includes information about taxi rides, such as pickup and dropoff locations, timestamps, and fare amounts.

## Analysis
1. **Preprocessing**: The raw data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers (using z-score), and any inconsistencies in the data.
2. **Manipulation**: Various manipulation techniques were applied to the data to extract meaningful insights. This included grouping the data by time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) and distinguishing between weekdays and weekends.
3. **Analysis**: Analytical techniques were applied to determine the best places to stand for taxi pickups based on the time of day and whether it's a weekday or weekend.

## Results
The analysis revealed specific locations that are optimal for taxi pickups during different times of the day and on weekdays versus weekends. These insights can be valuable for taxi drivers, passengers, and urban planners.


## Usage
